Not sure how to start one of these off... 

The goal of this project is to create a free tool for users to monitor and contribute data during a wildfire event. Intended for both professional firefighters as well as the general public. Fuel (vegetation, anything that can burn), weather, topography.

For the professional firefighter:
Using a registration process of some sort, each individual resource assigned to an incident by dispatch is monitored and updated with information while committed. Allowing a firefighter in the field to contribute environmental observations and fuel conditions would allow the network to stitch together hundreds of location specific reference points and create a much more comprehensive snapshot of the current situation. 

For the public
Public information officers and department officials can share a live version of the map and create notes, input contact info, mark hazards and highlight important evacuation routes all within a common medium (app). 

Using Google API and GPX route mapping it would be useful to identify topographical features near a user and allow them to add location based observations. The app output would generate a map that allows a user to view color based map tile snapshots of an evolving wildfire.

By using trained fire behavior experts (like local Captain's, Batt. Chiefs...) to identify (by circling on Google Earth Pro?) areas of high wildfire hazard - ridges, saddles, canyons, box canyons, etc are all markable features. AI/ML could eventually recognize these features by photo comparison with mathematical models I've created. 

Eventually a large enough network will exist for any user to tap into and obtain information relevant to their specific location. 

Much more to explain but free time is an issue these days. Will update soon.
